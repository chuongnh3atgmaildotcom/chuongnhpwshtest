why 2 start, where is the first come form: no matching jobrecord id -> another guy did it with irrelevant TargetResourceGroup sactcms4903951pwp001

why reset before start? -> it sort by last status update, actually start is created before reset but reset finish first

way to link start + reset by a same deployment trigger
2 reset job has same StartEPiDeploymentJobId a002f853-ddb2-4aa2-be4b-51c859de89ed

why start + reset dep? also irrelevant, it will not auto trigger

filter jobs by type: go to runbook
filter by Id: job list inside runbook.
filter by kql queries in Log Analytics workspaces:

why portal show error but az show warning?
Failed to prepare container 'quicksilvernetcore.cms.app.0.1.1.nupkg' in repository 'cms' on ACR 'chngcommerc99sab'. Retry attempts left: 1. The error was: az exited with error: 1. ERROR: The run with ID 'cg1' finished with unsuccessful status 'Failed'. Show run details by 'az acr task show-run -r chngcommerc99sab --run-id cg1'. Show run logs by 'az acr task logs -r chngcommerc99sab --run-id cg1'.


Direct deploy is required for database package? it's by design, because of reasons

why latest commerce went into generic QAAutomationAccount?
see app function -> get Automation account. It will automatically rotate between 2 hardcoded accounts.

flow: 1.(repo epicloud) -> 2.paasportal (repo paas) -> 3.az runbook (repo epi-deployment) -> 4.az cloud or cloudflare
customer's dev use 1st to deploy.
customer's dev + dxp cs use 2st to update infra
not complex operator (list hostname, purge cache) will go straight to step 4

ways to interract directly with azure api? yes just login or get a key
